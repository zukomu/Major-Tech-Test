# MajorTechTest

This was put together at the request of a member of Major Digital. I was instructed to recreate an image of a website that was provided to me using Angular. 

## Development Notes
As part of the project, I was instructed to note down any questions that came to me during the project, specifically regarding what details were missing in the image provided, and whether I had to make any assumptions. 

The main assumption that I had to make was what the inside of the dropdown menus looked like. I figured that because of the different symbols that appeared in the dropdown buttons, there were two different kind of dropdowns. I figured that the burger menu would contain more detail and the chevron menu would be more simplistic. I ended up deciding to include images in the burger menu as a way to signify the difference between the kinds of menu that didn't require much extra work, as this was only supposed to be a 2 hour project max.

There was also some functionality that I had to infer, specifically what the buttons did. I decided that, besides the ones that controlled the dropdown, they would all be links to other parts of the site.  

Other than that, there wasn't much that I couldn't figure out from looking at the image provided. I was able to use the Chrome colour picker to get the exact right colours most of the time. I was able to create a decent facsimile of the background image based on something I found on Google Images to replace the background image on the prompt. 

All in all, I'm very happy with the result. I'm sure there are elements of it that could be improved but, considering the limited time I put into it, I'm more than happy to call this done.
